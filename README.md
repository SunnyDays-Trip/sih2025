Smart Advisory for Marginal Farmers is a technology-driven solution designed to empower small and marginal farmers with timely, actionable insights. The system provides recommendations on crop selection, sowing schedules, irrigation management, pest control, and weather advisories, helping farmers make informed decisions and improve productivity.

Our goal is to bridge the information gap for farmers in rural areas, especially those with limited resources, by providing them with easy-to-understand, real-time guidance. By leveraging data and smart algorithms, the advisory system aims to reduce crop losses, optimize yield, and ensure better livelihood for marginal farmers.
